Fixed Kirby Bug with Block linking on. When Kirby collided with character, his face would remain smashed in.
This fix is in dynabranch.h. When blocks are linked, the next fpu instruction at the target needs to be able to test for a CP1 unusable exception.

MTC0 CP0[CAUSE] now supports new Interrupts. This needs to be done across STATUS and in other places including TLB ops and probably other areas. Look SET_EXCEPTION() will be different for different types of exceptions, so we may need another set of functions that SET the proper exception other than EXC_INT.
